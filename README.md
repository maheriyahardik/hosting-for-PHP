Great! Since you have hosting for PHP, hereâ€™s what you need to do to host your PHP CRUD project online:

âœ… 1. Prepare Your Files
Make sure your project folder includes these files:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
crud/
â”œâ”€â”€ db.php
â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
â”œâ”€â”€ add.php
â”œâ”€â”€ edit.php
â”œâ”€â”€ delete.php
You can also include a style.css if you have separate CSS.

âœ… 2. Compress the Folder
Zip the entire crud/ folder as crud.zip.

âœ… 3. Upload to Hosting
Login to your hosting panel (e.g., cPanel, DirectAdmin).

Go to File Manager.

Navigate to: public_html/

Upload crud.zip and extract it.

Youâ€™ll now have a folder like:
https://hardikphp.ct.ws/index.php

âœ… 4. Create the MySQL Database
In cPanel:

Go to MySQLÂ® Databases.

Create a new database (e.g., youruser_crud_demo).

Create a new user and assign it to the database with ALL privileges.

Note down:

DB name

DB user

DB password

âœ… 5. Import the SQL Table
Go to phpMyAdmin in cPanel.

Select your new database.

Click Import, and upload this SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);
(Optional) Insert one test record to see if it's working.

âœ… 6. Update db.php
Edit the db.php file:


âœ… 7. Access Your Website
Now you can open:

arduino
Copy
Edit
(https://hardikphp.ct.ws/index.php)
And your CRUD app should work live! ðŸŽ‰
